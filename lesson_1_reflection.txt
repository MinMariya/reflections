How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    We can see all changes that were done in newer version, it helps us to find a bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    When you have the entrie history of a file you can see all changes that were made.
    And you can find a bug easily, you don't need to look through entire file, only changes.
    It saves your time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - manually choosing allows to create the commits not too often, only when 
    logical changes were done.
    Cons - you can forget to create a commit manually and lose the changes 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all commets that were done
    git diff shows all changes that were done in a file in comparison with previous
    commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control allows to find the first commit with the bug. So you can
    roll back the version without bug in any time. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
