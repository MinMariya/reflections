What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your 
necessary repository files
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out 
of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information 
about what will go into your next commit.
